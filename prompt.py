1.I have a long script written in English. I want you to help me translate and rewrite it into Spanish while keeping the following requirements in mind:
2✅ Language: Translate the entire script into Spanish—but use simple, clear, and znatural-sounding Spanish.
3 ✅ Tone and Style: Maintain the same tone, narrative style, atmosphere, and storytelling structure as the original English version. The genre is sci-fi, so preserve the immersive and futuristic vibe.
4 ✅ Length and Structure: Keep the same length and structure as the original. If it’s broken into parts or scenes, make sure the Spanish version matches those parts closely.
5✅ Sense and Emotion: Don’t just translate word-for-word—rewrite it slightly in Spanish to make it feel natural, but ensure the original meaning, emotions, and context are preserved exactly.
6✅ Segmented Workflow: The script is too long to handle all at once. I will send it in multiple sections (each around 700–900 words or more). Translate and rewrite each section individually. Wait for my confirmation before continuing to the next one
7 ✅ Seamless Flow: Make sure the translated section transitions smoothly to the next one and matches the flow of the story. Add or adjust connectors in Spanish only if necessary
8. ✅ No Headings Needed: Do not add any headings like “Section 1” or “Translation” unless I ask for it
9. ✅ Completion Notes: At the end of each section, let me know the approximate word count and how many sections are remaining if I told you the total length of the script.
10✅ talk with me in english and tell me the translation are comleted okay lets start…
Dont break in section translate in one time
